# Continual Test-Time Adaptation in Federated Setting
This repository contains the codebase for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in a Federated Setting. The framework enables federated clients to continually adapt their models to evolving data distributions during test time, improving robustness and generalization without requiring centralized data collection.
